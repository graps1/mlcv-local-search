\section{Notation}
Let $A$ be some set. We will denote the set $\{ \{ a_1, \dots, a_k \} \subseteq A : a_1,\dots,a_k\ \text{pairwise distinct}\}$, which contains all $k$-ary subsets of $A$, by $\binom{A}{k}$. For the same set $A$, $P_A$ denotes the set of all partitions of $A$. For a partition $\Pi \in P_A$ and an element $a \in A$, $[a]_\Pi$ denotes the set in $\Pi$ that contains $a$, of which there is exactly one. If $A$ is finite, $\Uc(A)$ denotes the uniform distribution over $A$, i.e. the distribution that assigns every element in $A$ the same probability (namely: $1/|A|$). If we want to indicate that a random variable ${\bf X}$ has probability distribution $\mathcal{Q}$, we will write ${\bf X} \sim \mathcal{Q}$. If $f$ is a function from the domain of a random variable ${\bf X} \sim \mathcal{Q}$ to the real numbers, its expected value is written as $\E_{{\bf X} \sim \mathcal{Q}}\left[f({\bf X})\right]$.  

\section{Introduction}
Let $V = \{ v_1,\dots,v_n \}$ be a finite set of vertices. Associated with this set are functions $c,c': \binom{V}{3} \mapsto \R$ which define cost-structures on $3$-ary subsets of $V$. For a $3$-ary subset $\{u,v,w\} \in \binom{V}{3}$ and a given partition $\Pi \in P_V$, we define the cost of $\{u,v,w\}$ with respect to $\Pi$ as  
\begin{align*}
    \ell(\{u,v,w\},\Pi) = \begin{cases}
        c(\{u,v,w\}) & \text{if}\ [u]_\Pi \neq [v]_\Pi, [u]_\Pi \neq [w]_\Pi, [w]_\Pi \neq [v]_\Pi \\
        c'(\{u,v,w\}) & \text{if}\ [u]_\Pi = [v]_\Pi = [w]_\Pi \\
        0 & \text{otherwise.}
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}
This can be interpreted as follows: whenever $u,v$ and $w$ are part of pairwise different sets in $\Pi$, the cost of $\{u,v,w\}$ is equal to the costs as defined by $c$. If they are part of the same set, the cost of $\{u,v,w\}$ is equal to the costs as defined by $c'$. Otherwise, if neither of the above is the case, the cost of $\{u,v,w\}$ is just $0$. Based on this definition, we are confronted with problems of the form
\begin{align*}
    \Pi^* = \argmin_{\Pi \in P_V} \sum\nolimits_{\{u,v,w\} \in \binom{V}{3}} \ell(\{u,v,w\},\Pi)
\end{align*}
i.e. we wish to find a partition $\Pi^*$ of $V$ that minimizes some objective function over $3$-ary subsets of $V$. This problem is hard in many respects: one, the amount of possible partitions grows large very fast (with growing $n$). Two, even computing the objective function for a given partition is prohibitive, since summing over all $3$-ary subsets takes almost $n^3$ steps (and to add to that, not even $n^2$ steps are feasible if $n$ becomes larger). Thus, we are interested in a way of approximately solving this problem by the use of a local search algorithm and some considerations on the objective function.

\paragraph{Approximizing the Objective Function}
Since we are only interested in some minimizer $\Pi^*$ of the above problem, it does not matter which function we minimize, as long as the set of minimizers stays the same. Therefore, we can apply any strongly monotonic growing function to the objective, and, for example, multiply by some constant. We are then able to obtain
\begin{align*}
    \Pi^* &= \argmin_{\Pi \in P_V} \sum\nolimits_{T\in\binom{V}{3}} \ell(T,\Pi) \\
    &= \argmin_{\Pi \in P_V} \frac{1}{|\binom{V}{3}|} \sum\nolimits_{T\in\binom{V}{3}} \ell(T,\Pi) \\
    &= \argmin_{\Pi \in P_V} \mathbb{E}_{{\bf T} \sim \Uc\left(\binom{V}{3}\right)} \left[\ell({\bf T}, \Pi)\right]
\end{align*}
where $\Uc(\binom{V}{3})$ is the uniform distribution over $\binom{V}{3}$. This perspective allows to approximate the objective value to any degree by uniformly sampling a fixed number of $3$-ary subsets from $V$ and then computing the sample mean. In many cases, one wants to compute the change in the objective function when considering two different partitions $\Pi,\Pi' \in P_V$. The difference is then given by
\begin{align*}
    \mathbb{E}_{{\bf T} \sim \Uc\left(\binom{V}{3}\right)} \left[\ell({\bf T}, \Pi)\right] - \mathbb{E}_{{\bf T} \sim \Uc\left(\binom{V}{3}\right)} \left[\ell({\bf T}, \Pi')\right] = \mathbb{E}_{{\bf T} \sim \Uc\left(\binom{V}{3}\right)} \left[\ell({\bf T}, \Pi) - \ell({\bf T}, \Pi')\right],
\end{align*}
which can possibly be simplified, dependent on the shape of $\Pi'$ with respect to $\Pi$ and vice versa.
